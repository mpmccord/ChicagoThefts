	abstract = {We examine the immediate effects and bounce-back from six modern health crises: 1968 Flu, SARS (2003), H1N1 (2009), MERS (2012), Ebola (2014), and Zika (2016). Time-series models for a large cross-section of countries indicate that real GDP growth falls by around three percentage points in affected countries relative to unaffected countries in the year of the outbreak. Bounce-back in GDP growth is rapid, but output is still below pre-shock level ﬁve years later. Unemployment for less educated workers is higher and exhibits more persistence, and there is signiﬁcantly greater persistence in female unemployment than male. The negative effects on GDP and unemployment are felt less in countries with larger ﬁrst-year responses in government spending, especially on health care. Affected countries’ consumption declines, investment drops sharply, and international trade plummets. Bounce-back in these expenditure categories is also rapid but not by enough to restore pre-shock trends. Furthermore, indirect effects on own-country GDP from affected trading partners are signiﬁcant for both the initial GDP decline and the positive bounce back. We discuss why our estimates are a lower bound for the global economic effects of COVID-19 and compare contours of the current pandemic to the historical episodes.},

	abstract = {This paper presents some procedures aimed at helping an applied time-series analyst in the use of power transformations. Two methods are proposed for selecting a variance-stabilizing transformation and another for bias-reduction of the forecast in the original scale. Since these methods are essentially model-independent, they can be employed with practically any type of time-series model. Some comparisons are made with other methods currently available and it is shown that those proposed here are either easier to apply or are more general, with a performance similar to or better than other competing procedures.},
