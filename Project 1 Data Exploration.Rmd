# Introduction
In this part of this study, for initial modeling and analysis, I will be looking at the total number of thefts from January 2001 - March 11, 2023 that were reported. Note that due to the large size of the original dataset (nearly 8 million rows), the raw data is not included in this repository. The raw data can be accessed <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/ijzp-q8t2/rows.csv">here.</a>

## Data Overview

For this partition of the data, there are two variables: year/month and the number of thefts reported in each month. The full dataset has more variables, which are described below. Each row in the full dataset represents an individual crime that was reported.

### Population Data Overview
The population data for this project was extracted using the US Census API ACS, which provided population data from 2005-2019 from Cook County. Since Cook County is the base of the Chicago metropolitan area, I chose to extract this data, and include a variable that scaled the number of thefts over time by the yearly population. So far, I haven't been able to track down monthly population data for the Chicago area.
Note that also the data from 2001-2005 is harder to access as it is only available through the population estimates API. Therefore, although the original dataset goes from 2001-2023, at this time, I am focusing on 2005-2019. The population from the Chicago website is limited to 2018-2022.

Additionally, I have chosen to focus on monthly unemployment data from 2001-2022 as a predictor of thefts, from the same time period.

```{r}
thefts <- read_csv("data/thefts_unemployment_population.csv") %>%
  mutate(Month = yearmonth(Month)) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = Month)
```

### Raw Number of Thefts
```{r}

  features(NumThefts, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)
lambda

  autoplot(NumThefts)
  lambda <- thefts |>
  features(NumTheftsPer10000, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)
lambda
thefts <- thefts  %>%
  mutate(TheftsPer10000Transformed = box_cox(NumTheftsPer10000, lambda))
thefts <- thefts %>%
  mutate(NumTheftsTransformed = box_cox(NumThefts, lambda))

# Plotting the Population Over the 10-Year Period
```{r}
population <- read_csv("data/chicago_city_pop_estimates.csv") %>%
  as_tsibble(index = Year)
population %>%
  autoplot(Population)
```


# Models
Initially, I will test the four simple models that we've covered in class: naive, seasonal naive, mean, and random walk with drift. There appears to be a stronger seasonal component than trend component, so my guess is that seasonal naive will probably perform the best, but I will test all 4 models with a test set and predicted set.

## Raw Count of Thefts

### Forecasting Number of Thefts from 2017-2019 {.tabset}

#### Model
```{r}
thefts_train <- thefts %>%
  filter(year(Month) < 2019)
raw_count.model <- thefts_train %>%
  model(
    naive = NAIVE(NumThefts),
    snaive = SNAIVE(NumThefts),
    mean = MEAN(NumThefts),
    lm = RW(NumThefts ~ drift()),
    
  ) 
raw_count.model.forecast <- raw_count.model %>%
  forecast(h = "3 years")
raw_count.model.forecast %>%
  autoplot(filter(thefts, year(Month) >= 2015))
```

```{r}
raw_count.model <- thefts_train %>%
  model(
    snaive = SNAIVE(NumTheftsTransformed)
    
  ) 
raw_count.model.forecast <- raw_count.model %>%
  forecast(h = "3 years")
raw_count.model.forecast %>%
  autoplot(thefts)
raw_count.model %>%
  gg_tsresiduals()
```

#### Plot
```{r}
raw_count.model.forecast %>%
  autoplot(thefts)
```

#### Tables
```{r}
raw_count.model.forecast %>%
  accuracy(thefts)
```

## Forecasting Number of Thefts Per Capita

```{r}
percapita.model <- thefts_train %>%
  model(
    naive = NAIVE(NumTheftsPer10000),
    snaive = SNAIVE(NumTheftsPer10000),
    mean = MEAN(NumTheftsPer10000),
    lm = RW(NumTheftsPer10000 ~ drift()),
    
  ) 
percapita.model.forecast <- percapita.model %>%
  forecast(h = "3 years")
percapita.model.forecast %>%
  autoplot(thefts)
```

#### Plot
```{r}
percapita.model.t <- thefts_train %>%
  model(
    naive = NAIVE(TheftsPer10000Transformed),
    snaive = SNAIVE(TheftsPer10000Transformed),
    mean = MEAN(TheftsPer10000Transformed),
    lm = RW(TheftsPer10000Transformed ~ drift()),
    
  )
percapita.model.forecast <- percapita.model.t %>%
  forecast(h = "3 years")
percapita.model.forecast %>%
  autoplot(thefts)
percapita.model.forecast %>%
  accuracy(thefts)
```

#### Tables
```{r}
percapita.model.forecast %>%
  accuracy(thefts)
```

### Residuals of the Best Method

As I expected, the best performing model appears to be the seasonal naive model, across all measures. Now, I will look at the residuals to see whether they look like white noise.

```{r}
raw_count.snaive <- thefts %>%
  model(
    snaive = SNAIVE(NumTheftsPer10000)
  )
raw_count.snaive %>%
  gg_tsresiduals()

raw_count.t.snaive <- thefts %>%
  model(
    snaive = SNAIVE(TheftsPer10000Transformed)
  )
raw_count.t.snaive %>%
  gg_tsresiduals()
```

There is still significant autocorrelation in these residuals, and the distribution looks slightly left skewed. Therefore, the seasonal naive method is not appropriate for predicting the number of thefts over time.

## Exploring the Unemployment Variable {.tabsets}

This variable, taken from the Illinois website, explores the un-seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Chicago.

### Original Variable
```{r}
thefts %>%
  autoplot(`Unemployment Rate`)
```

### Transformed using Box Cox
```{r}
lambda <- thefts |>
  features(NumThefts, features = guerrero) |>
  pull(lambda_guerrero)

thefts <- thefts %>%
  mutate(UnemploymentRateTransformed = box_cox(`Unemployment Rate`, lambda))
thefts %>%
  autoplot(UnemploymentRateTransformed)
```

### Classical Decomposition {.tabset}

#### Additive
```{r}
thefts %>%
  gg_lag(`Unemployment Rate`, lags = 1:12)
```
```{r}
thefts %>%
  gg_season(`Unemployment Rate`)
```
```{r}
thefts %>%
  gg_subseries(`Unemployment Rate`)
```

```{r}
fc <- thefts %>%
  stretch_tsibble(.init = 3, .step = 1) %>%
  filter(.id < max(.id)) %>%
  model(
    snaive = SNAIVE(`Unemployment Rate`),
    lm = RW(`Unemployment Rate` ~ drift()),
    mean = MEAN(`Unemployment Rate`),
    naive = NAIVE(`Unemployment Rate`),
  ) %>% forecast(h = 3) |>
  group_by(.id) |>
  mutate(h = row_number()) |>
  ungroup() |>
  as_fable(response = "Unemployment Rate", distribution = `Unemployment Rate`)
```

```{r}
fc %>%
  accuracy(thefts)
```

```{r}
thefts |>
  model(RW(`Unemployment Rate` ~ drift())) |>
  gg_tsresiduals()
```
